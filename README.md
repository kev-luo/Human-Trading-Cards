## Description
This application generates custom html files based on user input through a CLI. The rendered html page displays your team member's roles and contact information, sorted by role. The pre-defined tests given to us were helpful in creating the employee classes. The use of inheritance also makes creating new classes less tedious. Finally this application exposed me to some of the applications of regex: rendering custom files, and form validation for the CLI.
